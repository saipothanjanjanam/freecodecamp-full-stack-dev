# Understand Absolute Vs Relative Units

### DESCRIPTION
* Commonly , we used pixels as units in measurements for applying styles to elements. But there are other units also.
* There are two types of units for length measurements.
    * Absolute Units - These are applied absolute to each element while taking the overall page into consideration. It has units in `mm`, `inches`. These measurements changes depending on the display resolution because as ppi(pixels per inch) changes because actual length units converted to pixels on screen. 
    * Relative Units - `em` and `rem` are the relative units. These are relative to another length value. `em` is the font family of the element. If we use `em` to font family itself then, it will apply w.r.t font family's `default size` or `parent's size`.
