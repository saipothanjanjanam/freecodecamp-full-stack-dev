# Use Abbreviated HEX Code 

### DESCRIPTION
* We can also use 3 digit hexadecimal code `#RGB` (one for `R`, one for `G` and one for `B` starting from `#000`(*black*) and runs till `#FFF`(*white*). By Simple math, each place in the 3 digit HEX Code takes 16 values, So total no of colors we can produce by combinations is `16*16*16 = 4096 colors`. It is good if we want to use less colors. 
* In below example, we define the `background-color` attribute has HEX Code value of `#F00` gives us `red` and likewise we can mix different values of `R`,`G`,`B` to get different colors.
```html
    <style>
        body {
            background-color: #F00;
        }
    </style>
    <body>
    </body>
```
