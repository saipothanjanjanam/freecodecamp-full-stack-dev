# Improve Compatibility With Browser Fallbacks 

### DESCRIPTION
* When working with CSS you will likely run into browser compatibility issues. 
* Some Browsers like `Internet Explorer` can't support CSS `variables`. So at that time browser show the that properties any value or default values which is not ideal, So we always attach a fallbacks by implementing the `same property` above the `property` with `css variable`.
* This means that if you do want to provide a browser fallback, it's as easy as providing another more widely supported value immediately before your declaration. That way an older browser will have something to fall back on, while a newer browser will just interpret whatever declaration comes later in the cascade.
