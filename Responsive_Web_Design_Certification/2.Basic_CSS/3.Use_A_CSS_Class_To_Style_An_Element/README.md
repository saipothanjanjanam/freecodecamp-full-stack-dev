# Use A CSS Class To Style An Element

### DESCRIPTION
* CSS Classes are used to style any number of HTML elements.
* They are flexible in nature.
* This is example,
```html
<style>
    .red-text {
        color:red;
    }
</style>
```
* Now you can directly include the `red-text` in `class` attribute of any HTML element to style it.
