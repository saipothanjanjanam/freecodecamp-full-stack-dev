# Decrease The Opacity Of An Element

### DESCRIPTION
* We can also apply `opacity` i.e transparency to the element text to make it more attractive and better visual experience.
* This transparency is applied with the CSS property `opacity`. It takes values from `0.0(transparent)` to `1.0(opaque)`.
    * A value of 1 is opaque, which isn't transparent at all.
    * A value of 0.5 is half see-through.
    * A value of 0 is completely transparent.
* This `opacity` is applied to entire element whether its a image or text with background, etc,.
* Below code applies `opacity` of value `0.5` to an `element` which uses `some-class` class.
```html
    <style>
    .some-class{
        opacity: 0.5;
    }
    </style>
```
