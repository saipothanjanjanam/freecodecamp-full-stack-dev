# Create A Gradual CSS Linear Gradient

### DESCRIPTION
* Not only single `hue` with `shades` and `tints` but also we can apply color transition aka transitions on the webpage.
* CSS provides the ability to use `color transitions`, otherwise known as gradients, on elements. This is accessed through the `background` property's `linear-gradient()` function.
* Below code applies gradient in the direction given by `angle` and the colors of transition from color1 to color2 to and so .. on we need to.
```html
<style>
	div{
		background: linear-gradient(gradient_direction, color 1, color 2, color 3, ...);	
	}
</style>
```
