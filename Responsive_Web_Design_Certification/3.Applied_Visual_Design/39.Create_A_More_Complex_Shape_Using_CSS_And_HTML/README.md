# Create A More Complex Shape Using CSS And HTML

### DESCRIPTION
* We can make much more complex shapes in HTML document using CSS psuedoclass selectors/psuedo-elements `before` and `after`.
* These are used to add something before and after a selected element.
* For the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements to function properly, they must have a defined `content` property. This property is usually used to add things like a photo or text to the selected element. When the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements are used to make shapes, the content property is still required, but it's set to an empty string.
