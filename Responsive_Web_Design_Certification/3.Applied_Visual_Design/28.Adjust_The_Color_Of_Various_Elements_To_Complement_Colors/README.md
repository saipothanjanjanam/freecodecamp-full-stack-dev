# Adjust The Color Of The Various Elements To Complement Colors

### DESCRIPTION
* The opposite colors on the color wheel can make each other appear more vibrant when placed side-by-side.
* However, the strong visual contrast can be jarring if it's overused on a website, and can sometimes make text harder to read if it's placed on a complementary-colored background. 
* In practice, one of the colors is usually dominant and the complement is used to bring visual attention to certain content on the page.
