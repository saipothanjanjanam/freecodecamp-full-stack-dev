# Push Elements Left Or Right With The Float Property

### DESCRIPTION
* We can also position the elements in webpage not only using `position` property but also by `float` property which pushes the elements `left` or `right` containing parent element.
* This `float` positioning removes the elements from normal flow and it is used with `width` so that the element can be moved `left` or `right` by maintaining its `width` to get required horizontal spacing.
* Below example applies `float` positioning to the `id` which can be applied to `element` to move it `left` and also changing the element`s with to 40%.
```html
<style>
    #some-id{
        float: left; 
    	width: 40%
    }
</style>
```
