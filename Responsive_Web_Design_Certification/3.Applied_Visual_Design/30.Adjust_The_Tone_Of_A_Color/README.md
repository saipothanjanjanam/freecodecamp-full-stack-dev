# Adjust The Tone Of A Color 

### DESCRIPTION
* In CSS `hsl()` property, h -> `Hue`, s -> `Saturation` and l -> `Lightness`. 
* After selecting the particular `color` or `hue`, we can apply the tone using `s` and `l` values of the `hsl` property.
* `Saturation` means the purity of the `Hue` or `color`. Like it denotes how much black or how much pure color should be. If `100%` then full color and if `0%` then grey without color or hue in it.
* `Lightness` means the amount of white in the `color` or `Hue`. If `100%` then total white, `50%` normal color and if `0%` then total black.
* Mixing white with a pure hue creates a `tint` of that color, and adding black to that color will make a `shade`. Alternatively, a tone is produced by adding gray or by both tinting and shading. Like we use `s` and `l` values for this purpose.
