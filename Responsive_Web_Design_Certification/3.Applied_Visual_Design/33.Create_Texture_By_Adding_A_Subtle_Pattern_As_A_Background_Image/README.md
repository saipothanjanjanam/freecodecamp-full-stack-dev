# Create Texture By Adding A Subtle Pattern As A Background Image

### DESCRIPTION
* One way to add texture and interest to a background and have it stand out more is to add a subtle pattern.
* The key is balance, as you don't want the background to stand out too much, and take away from the foreground.
* The background property supports the `url()` function in order to link to an image of the chosen texture or pattern. Give the `url` of the image we want to use inside the parenthesis of `url`
* We can apply this as the background image for the `body` element.
