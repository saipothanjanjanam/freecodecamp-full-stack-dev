# Adjust The Background Color Property Of Text

### DESCRIPTION
* We can make the content of the webpage more easily visual and comfortable using not only changing the color of text or the color of the overall background but `also by changing the color of the element itself which is verhy useful`.
* We commonly use `rgba` color for this, where `a` is alpha and its value varies from `0(transparent)` to `1(opaque)` and `r`,`g`,`b` takes values from `0(black)` to `255(full color)`.
* Below code applies color to the element `h5` with `a(alpha)` value is `0.1`.
```html
<style>
    h5{
        background-color: rgba(25, 25, 25, 0.1);
    }
</style>
<h5>Hello</h5>
```
