# Add Images To Your Website

### DESCRIPTION
* We can also add images to our webpages.
* We use `img` for adding images.
* `img` tag is single enclosed tag i.e it do not contain opening or ending tags.
* `src`, `alt` are the attributes for `img` tag.
* `src` attribute contains the weblink or local address to the image.
* `alt` attribute mainly helps us by giving description at the place of image, when image is not loaded in the webpage.
