# Declare The Doctype Of An HTML Document

### DESCRIPTION
* Commonly there is one thing that should be included in every `HTML` document.
* It is `DOCTYPE`, it helps browser in finding out the version used for making `HTML` pages so that it can display easily.
* `HTML` is improving day-by-day, So it is necessary for developers to include the version of `HTML` they've used for building the particular `HTML` document.
* For HTML,
```html
<!DOCTYPE ...>
```
* For HTML5,
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```
* In additional to `DOCTYPE`, we should include `<html>`, `</html>` tags and inside of the tags, all the `HTML` page content is to be written. 
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <!--HTML content goes here-->
</html>
```
* HTML is not case sensitive markup language.
