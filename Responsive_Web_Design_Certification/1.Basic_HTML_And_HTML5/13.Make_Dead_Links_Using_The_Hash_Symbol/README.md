# Make Dead Links Using The Hash(#) Symbol

### DESCRIPTION
* We can also create dead links or dummy links using `a`(anchor) tags.
* These will help us like a placeholder and a template for future use of linking the link.
* These dummy links can also be useful when using Javascript to tweak the urls, actions, etc.
* These dummy links are created using changing `href` attribute to `href="#"` i.e `#` as the placeholder.
